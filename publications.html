            <div class="pub-abstract">
              The COVID-19 pandemic challenged organizations to adapt under uncertainty and time pressure, with no preexisting protocols or guidelines available. For organizations to learn to adapt effectively, there is a need to understand the perspectives of the frontline workforce involved in everyday operations. This study implemented a survey-tool to evaluate frontline adaptation experiences in a radiology department during the early months of COVID-19, coded responses for adaptive strategies, and identified themes for building adaptive capacity. Results showed key processes of communication, role symmetry, rapid training, and reflective practice that supported resilience and suggest design implications for scaling proactive learning in complex healthcare settings.

              'Safety-II' is a new approach to safety, which emphasizes learning proactively about how safety and efficacy are achieved in everyday frontline work. Previous research developed a new lesson-sharing tool designed based on the Safety-II approach: Resilience Engineering Tool to Improve Patient Safety (RETIPS). The tool comprises questions designed to elicit narratives of adaptations that have contributed to effectiveness in care delivery. The purpose of this study is to revise and validate the design of RETIPS. The tool was revised based on feedback of clinicians at a large multi-specialty hospital, resulting in a version customized for anesthesia residents, RETIPS-AnRes. RETIPS-AnRes was administered on a pilot-basis to anesthesia resident groups for a limited period of time. A review of the reports obtained shows a strong alignment of responses with the conceptual basis of the tool, i.e. learning about how things go well in everyday work. The exemplars include both, specific instances of successful patient care, as well as generic routines that contribute to safe and/or effective care delivery. These findings support RETIPS as a tool to operationalize the Safety-II paradigm in healthcare. Lessons and implications for implementation on a wider scale are discussed.

              Resilience engineering (RE) has ushered in new approaches to learning about work in complex sociotechnical systems. In terms of improving safety, RE marks a shift from the traditional approach of retrospectively investigating adverse events, toward learning proactively about patterns in everyday work, including how things go well. This study applied the RE framework to the health care domain, by developing and implementing a new knowledge-elicitation protocol to learn about how frontline care providers achieve safe and effective patient care in their everyday work. Eighteen participants, including physicians, nurses, residents, and clinical leaders from a range of specialties, were interviewed using the new protocol. Qualitative analysis of the data revealed multiple themes and patterns which underlie resilient functioning of individuals, teams, and the organization as a whole. Further, a Resilience Mapping Framework (RMF) was developed based on major thematic categories to systematically represent and map various resilient capabilities—monitoring, anticipating, responding, and learning—across different levels of system scale, from the individual to the organizational.

            <div class="pub-abstract">
              Background: Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) training in Western countries is limited by insufficient expert instructors. Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) can help articulate expert decision-making and skill structure. We conducted CTA interviews with expert endoscopists performing ESD and identified cognitive and sensory cues, decision points, and error recoveries. Based on this, we proposed a framework for training design that includes cognitive-skills modules, simulation tasks, and targeted feedback. The findings have implications for improved curricula in advanced endoscopy training.

              Purpose: To evaluate the usability and decision-making impact of novel information displays designed for Emergency Department physicians in a high-fidelity simulation environment. Method: Seventy physicians participated in four clinical scenarios, using either standard displays or experimental displays with advanced visualizations. We measured decision response times, error rates, and subjective workload. Results: The experimental displays showed improved situational awareness, shorter response times, and lower error rates. Key usability factors included display layout, colour coding, and integration of alerts. Conclusion: This study supports design of advanced information displays that align with cognitive workflows in high-stress ED environments.

              This scoping review examines current instruments used to quantify emergency-physician workload across cognitive, physical, and temporal dimensions. Drawing from 82 studies, it identifies major gaps in psychometric validity and contextual adaptability. Most workload scales were found to be task-specific and poorly correlated with objective measures such as patient census or acuity. Recommendations include development of multi-dimensional tools aligned with real-time EHR and human-factors data streams.

            <div class="pub-journal">Authorea Preprints <span class="pub-year">2025</span></div>
            <div class="pub-abstract">
              This preprint introduces a framework using open-source LLMs to extract systems-level insights from hospital incident-report narratives. The approach classifies reports by contributing factors (communication, workflow, technology) and clusters them using semantic embeddings to surface recurrent safety themes. Preliminary evaluation against expert-coded datasets shows promising recall for multi-label categorization. The method supports scalable, automated learning from large repositories of free-text safety reports.

            <div class="pub-abstract">
              This paper reviews existing user-experience (UX) methods applied in healthcare device usability testing, highlighting gaps in aligning human-factors principles with real-world medical workflows. Through a structured review of peer-reviewed studies and regulatory guidelines (FDA, ISO 62366), the analysis identifies trends in formative and summative testing practices, task-based evaluations, and metrics for effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. Findings show that while healthcare usability testing often emphasizes error reduction and compliance, fewer studies examine cognitive workload and recovery from use errors. The paper concludes with recommendations for integrating contextual inquiry and simulation-based testing to improve safety and usability outcomes in healthcare technology design.

              This study evaluates the reliability and quality of YouTube videos disseminating information on Omicron variant symptoms and preventive measures. A systematic search retrieved 120 videos, screened and rated using the DISCERN and Global Quality Scoring tools. Results show that only 28% of videos provided medically accurate information, while 46% contained partial or misleading statements. Videos produced by healthcare professionals scored significantly higher than those by independent creators (p < 0.01). The findings underline the need for stronger content verification and health communication strategies on social media platforms, as public reliance on user-generated content increases during pandemics.

              The paper formulates an optimization model integrating ridesharing dynamics into urban disaster-evacuation planning. By incorporating vehicle-capacity constraints, pickup-drop-off coordination, and stochastic demand, the model minimizes total evacuation time under resource scarcity. Computational experiments on real-world city networks show that ridesharing can improve evacuation efficiency by up to 22% compared to private-vehicle scenarios. The framework provides guidance for emergency management agencies seeking collaborative mobility solutions.

              This paper analyzes how online attention dynamics contribute to the temporal clustering of mass-shooting incidents. Using large-scale Twitter and Reddit data, a contagion-inspired model quantifies the amplification effects of social-media coverage on subsequent event probability. Findings reveal a statistically significant relationship between spikes in online discussion and short-term increases in incident likelihood, suggesting that information diffusion mechanisms can influence behavioral contagion. Policy implications are discussed regarding media reporting and content moderation.
